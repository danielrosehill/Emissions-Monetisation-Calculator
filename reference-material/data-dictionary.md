## Comments
Any additional remarks or notes about the proposal.

## Climate Model Used
The climate model(s) used in deriving the SCC (e.g., DICE, FUND, PAGE).

## Currency
The currency in which the SCC value is denominated (e.g., USD, GBP).

## Damage Categories Included
A list of damage categories factored into the calculation (e.g., health impacts, agricultural losses, property damages).

## Discount Rate
The discount rate(s) used in the calculation of the SCC (e.g., 3%, 2%, 1%).

## Economic Model Used
The economic model(s) or framework applied in calculating costs.

## Equity Weighting
Whether equity weighting was applied to account for distributional impacts across regions or populations.

## Geographic Scope
The geographic region or scope for which the SCC applies (e.g., global, national, state-level).

## Inflation Adjustment Year
The base year for inflation adjustment if values are adjusted for inflation.

## Methodology
A brief description of the methodology used to calculate the SCC (e.g., integrated assessment model, empirically derived estimate).

## Policy Context
The policy application or context for which the SCC was intended (e.g., regulatory impact analysis, carbon tax setting).

## Proposal Name
Name or identifier of the social cost of carbon proposal.

## Proposal Year
The year the SCC estimate was proposed or published.

## Range High
If applicable, the upper bound of a range provided for the SCC estimate.

## Range Low
If applicable, the lower bound of a range provided for the SCC estimate.

## Range Average

If the social cost of carbon is stated as a range, then the mathematical average is also provided. 

## Source Document
The name of the report or publication where the estimate is documented.

## Source Organization
The organization or entity responsible for producing the SCC estimate (e.g., EPA, Interagency Working Group, New York DEC).

## Time Horizon
The time period over which the damages are calculated (e.g., 100 years, indefinite).

## Uncertainty Notes
Notes on uncertainties associated with the estimate (e.g., climate sensitivity, economic assumptions).

## Value
The numerical value of the SCC estimate.

## Value Units
The units in which the SCC is expressed (e.g., $/ton CO2, Â£/ton C).
